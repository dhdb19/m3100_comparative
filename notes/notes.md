## Feedback

Negative feedback:
    - Public as a thermostat (Wlezien, 1995): Policy stability as public opinions runs opposite to policy maing (Busemeyer et al., 2023, p. 137)


Interesting aspects: Busemeyer observes two possible explanations: 

1. Opposition to Trump government and leads to policy stability -> Negative feedback/public as a thermostat

2. Popularity of Obamacare/ACA is up -> Positive/self-reinforcing feedback.
