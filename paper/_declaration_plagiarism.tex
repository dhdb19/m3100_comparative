is the result of my own, independent work. I have not used any aids or sources other than those I have referenced in the document. For contributions and quotations from the works of other people (whether distributed electronically or in hardcopy), I have identified each of them with a reference to the source or the secondary literature. Failure to do so constitutes plagiarism. I will also submit the term paper electronically to the lecturer.\\

Furthermore, I declare that the above mentioned work has not been
otherwise submitted as a term paper.\\

Regarding the use of generative AI tools, I met the guidelines of the
lecturer and clarified them in case of doubt.

\begin{itemize}[labelwidth=0.65cm,align=parleft]
    \item[\mbox{\begin{Form}\CheckBox[height=0.2cm, width=0.2cm]{}\end{Form}}] I have used generative AI tools as an aid within the limits allowed by the lecturer. I understand that I am solely responsible for the accuracy of the content of the AI-generated text passages, as well as for referencing other people\textquotesingle s wording and ideas in accordance with the principles of good scientific practice. In the case of an adoption of AI-generated passages that go beyond purely formal, stylistic corrections, I have marked them and, in addition to the AI tool used, I have indicated the prompts I entered.
    
        
    \item[\mbox{\begin{Form}\CheckBox[height=0.2cm, width=0.2cm]{}\end{Form}}]I did not use any generative AI tools as aids.

I am aware of the following:

\begin{itemize}[label=\color{kon4}--, leftmargin=1.45cm, labelsep=0.45cm]
\item I am guilty of plagiarism if, contrary to the requirements set out above, I use the work of others in my thesis without acknowledging the precise source. This would be to lay claim to an achievement that is not my own.

\item If a candidate intentionally violates the University of Konstanz's Statutes to Ensure Good Scientific Practice when composing his/her thesis, it will be, in all probability, judged as an attempt at cheating (plagiarism). This means that the thesis will be graded \enquote{nicht ausreichend/fail} (5,0), placed on record in the student's examination file, and put before the Examination Board (StPA).

\item In repeated or particularly serious cases, the StPA may decide to exclude the candidate from further performance assessments, resulting in a complete loss of right to take any further examinations in this study programme.

\item The legal basis for this is laid down in the applicable examination regulations for the study programme in question.
\end{itemize}

I have taken note of these guidelines regarding plagiarism.
