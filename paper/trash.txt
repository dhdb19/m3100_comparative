% Leaving out Game Theory for the purposes of conciseness, \textcite[][]{Greif2004} point out several mechanisms by which, in contravention to Punctuated Equilibrium Theory and classical Historical Institutionalist expectation respectively, (1) exogenous shocks

% Both for the purposes of \citeauthor{Jacobs2014}'s \parencite*{Jacobs2014} and this paper, I will focus
% synthesizing criticisms of both classical Historical Institutionalist and punctuated equilibrium theory,arguing both that (1)  and (2) increasing returns are not necessarily or primarily the operative mechanism that cause policy stability, opening the possibility for a more complex typology of mechanisms.

% To illustrate the latter point, \textcite{Greif2004} illustrate present one example how increasing returns alone cannot be the sole determinant of policy stability. \textcite{Greif2004} argue that pensions programs generate decreasing returns, but are still self-reinforcing: The introduction of a national pension program will lead to (1) greater life-expectancy and (2) lower birth-rates as income in old age aids to prolong health and disincentives having children as old-age insurance, relatively to a situation without a pensions scheme. These demographic changes \textit{caused by the policy} (i.e. endogenous changes) in turn, over-time, will lead to a decrease in average pension payouts as the ration of young working people to old age recipients shifts. At the same time, however, support for the pension program will likely increase, as the relative share of the population that economically benefits as a consequence of the same demographic trends that cause the decline in payout, i.e. more pensioners relative to the working population.
